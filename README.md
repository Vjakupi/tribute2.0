# tribute2.0

Free Code Camp's first project. I did this a second time as it had been a couple months since I last completed this challenge. I completed it in far less time and didn't need to resort to looking at the original project's source code to meet all the required user stories. 

## Getting Started

If you'd like to try this prompt as well, I reccomend going to the FreeCodeCamp page here https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/responsive-web-design/responsive-web-design-projects/build-a-survey-form

The Codepen included is where I drew the inspiration for my own tribute page. 

### Prerequisites

You can entirely do this project off codepen.io 

I used VS Code and Github, preferring to gain practice with version control and text editors as well.

## Built With
* HTML
* Vanilla CSS
* [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) - Text Editor
* [W3C](https://validator.w3.org/) - HTML and CSS validation 
* [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) - Their documentation is always a great help 


## Versioning
V 1.0 - Basic HTML skeleton, basic CSS styling

## Authors
* **Valon Jakupi** - Authored all code as well as the original contents of the README
* **Billie Thompson** - Creator of this ReadME template.

* Thanks to /r/chessclub for the chess lessons in exchange for web dev work probably worth slightly less than the instruction provided!
